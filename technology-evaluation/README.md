# Technical Evaluation Documentation

## Evaluation Framework

### Core Value Assessment
Technologies were evaluated based on three key metrics:

1. **User Burden** (ユーザー負担)
- Low: File upload/option selection methods
- Medium: Keyword input methods
- High: Sentence input/combinations

2. **Processing Time** (処理時間)
- Seconds scale
- Tens of seconds
- Minutes scale
- Tens of minutes
- Hours scale
- Day scale

3. **Technology Level** (技術レベル)
- Level 2: Template-based reports
- Level 3: Interactive reports with user feedback
- Level 4: Self-learning capabilities
