# Technical Evaluation Summary

## Evaluation Framework
Technologies were systematically assessed across three main approaches:

### 1. All-in-One Execution (一括実行)
Systems capable of performing search, structuring, and summarization in a single flow
- Examples: TXYZ, Consensus
- Assessment focused on:
  * Completeness of output
  * Quality of source integration
  * Citation handling

### 2. Search-Only Technologies (検索のみ)
Specialized APIs and tools for accessing specific types of information
- Academic Papers: OpenAlex, Scopus
- Patents: SerpAPI (Google Patents)
- Web: DuckDuckGo, Tavily
- Assessment focused on:
  * Source coverage
  * Query capabilities
  * Rate limits and costs

### 3. AI Agent Frameworks (AIエージェントフレームワーク)
Frameworks for building research automation systems
- Examples: LangGraph, AutoGen
- Assessment focused on:
  * Flexibility of implementation
  * Japanese language support
  * Integration capabilities
